## Assignment 1 Shell

Implement a simple command line shell program in *C* that interacts with the user in the following way. By default, the shell gives a prompt to the user. When the user types in a command (in response to its prompt) and hits Enter, the shell creates a child process that executes the command he entered and displays the results if any. It then prompts for more user input by displaying the prompt again. 

For example, when the user types command ls, the shell should display a listing of files in the current working directory. Your program should achieve this by simply passing this command to the underlying shell and receiving the results generated by it. Do not try to implement the functionality of the command within your own program. **You MUST use fork and exec family of system calls for this assignment. **

The shell can be limited to handling basic commands that do not involve piping and redirection.

## Assignment 2 Shared Memory 

Write two simple C programs that communicate with each other via shared memory. The first program **receiver.c**  runs in an infinite loop receiving alpha numeric strings as input from the user, one line at a time. After reading one line from the standard input, this program sends this information to the other program only if the line contains the secret **code "C00L"**. The sharing of data between the two processes should take place via shared memory. The second program **processor.c** creates an output file secrets.out and waits for user input to be sent by the receiver program. As soon as one line is received from the receiver, it counts the number of digits in that line and dumps the digit count along with the original line in the **secrets.out** file. This program also runs in an infinite loop.
